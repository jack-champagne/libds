# libds

This is an ongoing project to implement reasonably efficient datastructures in c that are portable and dynamically
allocated. This library attempts to best hide implementation details while remaining understandble and easy to use.

This project is mainly for use in [algorithms](https://github.com/jack-champagne/algorithms)
